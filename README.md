:pencil2: NoteTaker.github.io

An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

As a user, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I want to be able to delete notes I've written before so that tasks are not repeated.
